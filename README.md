This project is about a Simple Calculator built using React hooks. I've also imported a library which can help to evaluate mathematical equations and I did String Manipulation between the inputs. This may not be the best workaround in this kind of project but I did it this way because this is what I've learned so far. Technologies involved in this project are ReactJS, HTML and SCSS.
